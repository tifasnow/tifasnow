## About Me

I'm a Operational Support Director for the [Project Viridian](https://projectviridian.com) team, and I'm also a freelance developer. I'm currently working on supporting a few projects aside from Project Viridian, including helping with Documentation for [KatCodes' MFFS](https://www.github.com/KatCodesMods/mffs) mod. I'm also working on a few personal projects, including a Discord bot, a locally-hosted Home Dashboard, and a few other things.

I'm currently trying to learn more about JavaScript, in particular React for web development. I'm also trying to learn more about PHP to support legacy projects.

## My Setup

- I mostly use macOS on a 2021 M1 Pro MacBook Pro, but I also have an Alienware x17 R1 running Windows 11 for testing. On the Linux side, I have a 2020 Intel MacBook Pro running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS however I don't use it much.

- I use an iPhone 13 Pro Max as my daily driver, but I also have a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra for testing and backup.

- Currently I'm using a Logitech G502 wired mouse, and an Apple Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, however I'm planning to upgrade both shortly to the Logitech MX Master 3 and the Logitech MX Keys respectively.
- I typically use the MacBook's built-in display, but I also have a 32" Samsung 4K monitor for when I need more screen real estate.
- I often listen to music while I work, through either Spotify or Apple Music and I use a pair of 2nd Gen Apple AirPod Pros or a Razer Wired headset.

## Free Time

- I enjoy playing video games on PC, Switch, and Xbox. My favorite games presently are the PokÃ©mon series, the Halo series, and Rainbow Six Siege and Extraction. I also enjoy playing the occasional game of Final Fantasy XIV with friends.
- I drink a lot of coffee, and I enjoy trying new beans and roasts. I also enjoy trying new teas, with my favorite being Twining's English Breakfast.
